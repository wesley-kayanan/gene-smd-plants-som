# gene-smd-plants-som
This is a project done for a class entitled "Representations and Algorithms for Computational Biochemistry" in UPM. The motivation of this project came from the thesis of a UP alumni were different groups were tasked to replicate portions of the project from scratch. With the guidance of the thesis paper, our group was tasked to cluster genes according to their plant and small-molecule drug (SMD) associations with the help of self-organizing maps (SOM), an unsupervised learning method.
